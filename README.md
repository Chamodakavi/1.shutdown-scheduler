# 🕒 Shutdown Scheduler

A simple Python-based PC/Laptop **shutdown scheduler** app built to automate system shutdowns — perfect for overnight downloads, energy saving, and productivity.

## 📌 Why I Built This

In **Sri Lanka**, many internet providers offer **unlimited data from 12:00 AM to 7:00 AM**. I often use that time to download large files (Games, Movies, Software) using tools like uTorrent.

But I leave for studies by 6:00 AM, and I didn’t want to keep my laptop running all day or manually shut it down when I return.  
So I built this tool to **automatically shut down my laptop at a time I choose** — usually 7:00 AM. Problem solved ✅
